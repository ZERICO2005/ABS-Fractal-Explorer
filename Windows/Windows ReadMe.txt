ABS-Fractal-Explorer
v1.0.1 Windows | 2023/08/15 | zerico2005

The Windows version of ABS-Fractal-Explorer was compiled and tested on Windows 10.
It will probably run on Windows 8.1/8/7 but I am not sure.

Make sure that libwinpthread-1.dll and SDL2.dll are in the same folder as ABS-Fractal-Explorer_v1-0-1.exe otherwise the software won't run.
