To compile, you may need a few to all of the following files in ./imgui
The files can be obtained from the Dear Imgui github repository https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
Additionally, changing <SDL.h> to <SDL2/SDL.h> could help if things are not working correctly.

imconfig.h
imgui.cpp
imgui.h
imgui_demo.cpp
imgui_draw.cpp
imgui_impl_sdl2.cpp
imgui_impl_sdl2.h
imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2.cpp
imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2.h
imgui_internal.h
imgui_tables.cpp
